#### String Problems Practice

##### Basic String Problems
- [ ] **Reverse a String:**  
  Write a function to reverse a given string.  
  *Example:* "hello" → "olleh"
- [ ] **Check if a String is a Palindrome:**  
  Determine whether a string reads the same backward as forward.  
  *Example:* "madam" → True, "hello" → False
- [ ] **Count Vowels and Consonants:**  
  Count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.  
  *Example:* "Hello World" → Vowels: 3, Consonants: 7
- [ ] **Remove Duplicates from a String:**  
  Remove all duplicate characters from a string while maintaining the order.  
  *Example:* "hello" → "helo"
- [ ] **Find the Most Frequent Character:**  
  Find the character that appears most frequently in a string.  
  *Example:* "hello" → 'l'

##### Intermediate String Problems
- [ ] **Anagram Check:**  
  Determine if two strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in different orders).  
  *Example:* "listen" and "silent" → True
- [ ] **Longest Palindromic Substring:**  
  Find the longest substring that is a palindrome.  
  *Example:* "babad" → "bab" or "aba"
- [ ] **String Compression:**  
  Compress a string by counting consecutive characters.  
  *Example:* "aaabbbcc" → "a3b3c2"
- [ ] **Valid Parentheses:**  
  Check if a string containing parentheses (), {}, and [] is valid.  
  *Example:* "[{()}]" → True, "[{(})]" → False
- [ ] **Reverse Words in a Sentence:**  
  Reverse the order of words in a sentence.  
  *Example:* "Hello World" → "World Hello"

##### Advanced String Problems
- [ ] **Longest Common Prefix:**  
  Find the longest common prefix among a list of strings.  
  *Example:* ["flower", "flow", "flight"] → "fl"
- [ ] **Implement strstr() or indexOf():**  
  Implement a function to find the first occurrence of a substring in a string.  
  *Example:* ("hello world", "world") → 6
- [ ] **Minimum Window Substring:**  
  Given two strings s and t, find the minimum window in s that contains all characters of t.  
  *Example:* ("ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC") → "BANC"
- [ ] **Regular Expression Matching:**  
  Implement a function to match a string against a pattern with `.` (matches any single character) and `*` (matches zero or more of the preceding element).  
  *Example:* ("aab", "c*a*b") → True
- [ ] **Group Anagrams:**  
  Group a list of strings into groups of anagrams.  
  *Example:* ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"] → [["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]

##### Hard-Level String Problems
- [ ] **Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance):**  
  Find the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, replace) required to convert one string to another.  
  *Example:* ("horse", "ros") → 3
- [ ] **Word Break Problem:**  
  Determine if a string can be segmented into space-separated words from a dictionary.  
  *Example:* ("leetcode", ["leet", "code"]) → True
- [ ] **Text Justification:**  
  Align a block of text so that each line has exactly L characters, fully justified.  
  *Example:* (["This", "is", "an", "example"], L = 16) → "This is an example"
- [ ] **Wildcard Matching:**  
  Match a string against a pattern with `?` (matches any single character) and `*` (matches any sequence of characters).  
  *Example:* ("adceb", "*a*b") → True
- [ ] **Serialize and Deserialize a String:**  
  Serialize a string into a compact format and deserialize it back.  
  *Example:* "Hello World" → Serialized: "5#Hello5#World", Deserialized: "Hello World"
